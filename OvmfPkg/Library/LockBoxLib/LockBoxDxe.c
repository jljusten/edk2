/**
  Allocates a buffer of type EfiACPIMemoryNVS.

  Allocates the number bytes specified by AllocationSize of type
  EfiACPIMemoryNVS and returns a pointer to the allocated buffer.
  If AllocationSize is 0, then a valid buffer of 0 size is
  returned.  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy
  the request, then NULL is returned.

  @param  AllocationSize        The number of bytes to allocate.

  @return A pointer to the allocated buffer or NULL if allocation fails.
